《On Identity: The Battle From Within》

Well, thank you. And thank you to the professor, and to all of you, my fellow students, for being here.
It’s great to be with you today at the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. We are, of course, thrilled to be here.
I’m just a student, like most of you. I walk the same halls; I study in the same libraries. And I’ve learned that each of us carries a story - a story of our family, our struggles, our faith, and our dreams. That story is who we are.
【互动：掌声】Now I hope it’s not the last bit of applause that I get, but-
But I’m here today with an observation, and frankly, with a warning.

We gather at a university, a place meant for the pursuit of truth. Normally, we talk about external threats to our future — job markets, competition, and the economy.
But the threat that I worry about the most is not job markets, it's not competition, it's not the economy, it’s not any other external actor.
What I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of us from our own stories, from our own identities.

I look around, and I saw something hypothetical disturbing:
1.I saw hypothetical students were told that their hypothetical traditions were backward. I saw hypothetical  voices were shouted down in the hypothetical classroom for daring to question the hypothetical latest ideological trend.
2.I saw a hypothetical young man, a hypothetical member of a hypothetical student club, were pressured to resign because he had expressed a hypothetical view that was… inconvenient. He wasn’t hateful. He wasn’t disruptive. He just had a different opinion.
3.And perhaps most chillingly, I saw some administrators, of course, hypothetical, sending out emails, warning us about so-called "harmful speech," creating an atmosphere where we were afraid to speak our minds, to share our real stories — lest we offended the hypothetical  ever-growing list of forbidden thoughts.
And I say we, because I fundamentally believe that we are on the same team.
We must do more than just talk about liberal values.  We must live them.

Now, in the impression of many of you in this room, the Second World War and the National Liberation War positioned defenders of freedom against much more tyrannical（/tɪˈrænɪkl/，专制的） forces on this continent.
And consider the side in that fight that censored dissidents（/ˈdɪsɪdənts/，持不同政见者）, that closed schools, that cancelled elections.
Ask yourselves: Are they the good guys? Certainly not.
And thank God they lost the Second World War and the Liberation War. 
They lost because they did not value the most fundamental freedom: the freedom to be who you are, to make mistakes, to learn, and to grow.
As it turns out, you can’t mandate a new identity any more than you can force someone to think what to think or to believe what to believe.

So, I come here today not just with an observation, but with an offer.
It is an offer to push back, to reject these tired and oppressive new rules. Just as the forces of conformity（/kənˈfɔːməti/，从众） seem desperate to silence people for speaking their minds, we must do precisely the opposite.
I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns — or worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections, or shutting people out of the political process — protects nothing.
In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy freedom. And speaking up and expressing opinions isn’t secession.
And what no republic — China, Japan, or even America — will survive, is telling millions of, billions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief, are invalid or unworthy of even being considered.
Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There is no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don’t.
We have a voice. And we have a choice. And my strong belief is that we do not need to be afraid of who we are.
We may disagree with each other’s views, but we must fight to defend each other’s right to offer them in the public square. That is the foundation of a true community.
Now, I’m sure many of you are thinking about your careers, about how you’ll pass your next exam. And that’s great. It’s important.
But let me ask you: How can you build a successful life, a life of meaning, if you don’t even know who you are? If you’re not allowed to be who you are?
What is the positive vision we’re building towards if we’re ashamed of our own stories?
I believe deeply that there is no success, no future, if you are afraid of the voice and the conscience that guide your very own soul.
To believe in freedom is to understand that each of us has wisdom and has a voice. And if we refuse to listen to that voice, even our most successful fights will secure very little.
As Chairman Deng, in my view, one of the most extraordinary champions of freedom on this continent or any other, once said, “do not be afraid”.

The crisis we face right now is one of our own making. It is a crisis of courage.
If you’re running in fear of your own classmates, of your own professors, there is no curriculum that can save you.
You cannot win the respect of others by censoring your opponents or hiding your true self.
Your identity is not a liability（/ˌlaɪəˈbɪləti/，负担）. It is your greatest asset. It is rooted in your story, forged（/fɔːdʒd/，铸就） by your struggles.
Do not be afraid of it.
Do not be afraid of your classmates, even when they express views that disagree with yours.
Do not be afraid of your own story, even when it doesn't fit the template they’re trying to force on you.
Have the courage to be you. To speak. To push back.
That is how we win this battle from within.
Thank you all. And good luck to all of you. Merry Christmas.
